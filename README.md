**Getting Started Locally**

To get started with development on this project, clone this repository:
`git clone git@github.com:JackB47/synoptic-project-2020.git`

This project uses the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager over NPM as it installs any necessary packages simultaneously which makes installation much faster than NPM.

To run this you will need NodeJS and the Gatsby CLI and the instructions for this can be found [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/). This basic tutorial will help get you up and running for when you first run a Gatsby site locally depending on your operating system.

After cloning the repistory run `yarn` and this will install all the necessary dependenceies.

Now you can run `yarn develop` or `gatsby develop` and the site will now be visible at `localhost:8000`
