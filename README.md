**Getting Started**

To get started with development on this project, clone this repository:
`git clone git@github.com:JackB47/synoptic-project-2020.git`

This project uses the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager over NPM as it installs any necessary packages simultaneously which makes installation much faster than NPM.

After cloning the repistory run `yarn` and tis will install all the necessary dependenceies.

Now you can run `yarn develop` or `gatsby develop` and the site will now be visible at `localhost:8000`
